# Chatbot - AI-powered Text, Image, SQL Query, and Web Summary Generator

## Introduction
This project is aimed at creating a web application that integrates multiple OpenAI models such as Davinci 003, DALL-E, GPT 3.5-Turbo, Rapid APIs, and provides a chatbot interface. The application will be capable of generating text, images, SQL query, and web summaries based on user input prompts. The integration of advanced AI models into a single application will provide a unique and interactive experience for users.

## Objective

- Node.js version 12 or higher
- npm version 6 or higher

#### Step 1: Install Vite
**<ins>Vite</ins>** is a build tool that helps in quickly setting up a modern development environment for web applications. It offers several features such as lightning-fast cold server start, hot module replacement, and support for various front-end frameworks such as React, Vue, and Angular.

*To install Vite, you can use the following command*

```
npm install vite
```

Once Vite is installed, you can use it to create a new project with a specific front-end framework. For example, to create a new React project with Vite, you can run the following command:

```
npm init vite@latest my-react-app --template react
```
